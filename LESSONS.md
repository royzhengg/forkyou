# Lessons Learnt — forkyou

Rules and patterns we've discovered the hard way. Apply these from the start on any new feature.

## Architecture

### Extract data fetching into custom hooks
Never write Supabase queries directly inside screen components. Put them in `lib/hooks/useXxx.ts`. Screens render UI; hooks fetch data.

**Pattern:**
```ts
// lib/hooks/useSavedLocations.ts
export function useSavedLocations(userId: string | undefined) {
  // all fetch logic here
  return { savedLocations, error, refresh }
}
// screen: const { savedLocations } = useSavedLocations(user?.id)
```

**Why:** When queries are inline, they're hard to test, hard to reuse, and the screen file grows unmanageable. Hooks also make it trivial to swap Supabase for a different backend later.

---

### Always handle errors from Supabase
Every query must check `error` and surface it. Silent failures make debugging impossible.

**Pattern:**
```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('table').select(...)
if (error) { setError(error.message); return }
```

**Why:** Supabase can fail for many reasons (RLS, network, schema changes). Without an error state the user sees nothing and you have no signal.

---

### Add `.limit()` to every query from the start
Every Supabase query must have an explicit limit. Use `100` as a default cap; bump when adding pagination.

```ts
.select('...').eq('user_id', userId).limit(100)
```

**Why:** Unbounded queries return everything in the table as the dataset grows. Adding limits later requires finding every query across the codebase.

---

## Performance

### Wrap list-item components in `React.memo`
Any component rendered inside a list (map, FlatList, etc.) should be memoized.

```tsx
const PostCard = React.memo(function PostCard({ post, colWidth }) { ... })
```

**Why:** Without memo, a parent state change (e.g. tab switch, theme toggle) re-renders every card even if nothing about the card changed.

---

### Use `useCallback` for handlers passed to memoized children
`React.memo` is useless if the props passed to the child are new references every render.

```tsx
const navigateTo = useCallback((loc) => { ... }, [router])
// pass as: onPress={navigateTo}
```

**Why:** An inline `onPress={() => navigateTo(loc)}` creates a new function every render, defeating the memo.

---

### Use `react-native-reanimated` for all animations — never `Animated` from react-native
Reanimated runs on the UI thread; `Animated` runs on the JS thread.

```tsx
import Animated, { useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withSpring } from 'react-native-reanimated'
const slideY = useSharedValue(300)
slideY.value = withSpring(0, { damping: 20, stiffness: 180 })
const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({ transform: [{ translateY: slideY.value }] }))
```

**Why:** JS-thread animations stutter during any JS work (navigation, data fetching). UI-thread animations are guaranteed 60fps.

---

### Wrap icon components in `React.memo`
Standalone icon functions that call `useThemeColors()` should be memoized at the module level.

```tsx
const BellIcon = React.memo(function BellIcon() {
  const colors = useThemeColors()
  return <Svg ...>
})
```

**Why:** Icon components defined as plain functions recreate on every render of the parent. In a tab bar or list header this fires constantly.

---

### `useMemo` for computed/derived values used in render
Any value computed from state that's used in JSX or passed to a child should be memoized.

```tsx
const validLocations = useMemo(
  () => savedLocations.filter(l => l.restaurants?.latitude != null),
  [savedLocations]
)
```

---

## Native / Maps

### Google Maps on iOS requires THREE things — all must be present
1. `iosGoogleMapsApiKey` (not `googleMapsApiKey`) in the react-native-maps plugin config in `app.json`
2. `pod 'react-native-maps/Google'` in `ios/Podfile`
3. `GMSServices.provideAPIKey(...)` called in `AppDelegate.swift` before any other setup

Missing any one of these causes a blank/white/black map with no error message.

---

### Always keep `MapView` mounted — never conditionally render it
Use `opacity: 0` + `pointerEvents: 'none'` to hide it, not conditional rendering or `display: 'none'`.

```tsx
<View style={[StyleSheet.absoluteFill, isHidden && { opacity: 0 }]} pointerEvents={isHidden ? 'none' : 'auto'}>
  <MapView ... />
</View>
```

**Why:** `MapView` needs to initialise with real dimensions. Conditional rendering gives it zero size on first mount → blank tiles. `display: 'none'` removes it from the native hierarchy → same problem.

---

### Add `tracksViewChanges={false}` to all `<Marker>` components
```tsx
<Marker coordinate={...} tracksViewChanges={false} onPress={...} />
```

**Why:** The default (`true`) causes every marker to re-render on every frame, tanking FPS on maps with many pins.

---

## Supabase Queries

### Parallelise independent queries with `Promise.all`
```ts
const [likesRes, commentsRes] = await Promise.all([
  supabase.from('likes').select(...),
  supabase.from('comments').select(...),
])
```

**Why:** Sequential awaits add latency equal to the sum of all requests. Independent queries should always run in parallel.

---

## Styling

### Always use `useMemo(() => makeStyles(c), [c])` — never module-level StyleSheet with colours
```tsx
const colors = useThemeColors()
const styles = useMemo(() => makeStyles(colors), [colors])
```

**Why:** Module-level `StyleSheet.create` with colour tokens runs once at import time and never updates. Theme changes and dark mode won't apply.

---

## Shared Components

### Never re-implement UI that already exists in components/
Before writing any icon, badge, rating display, or profile block — check `components/` first.

| Need | Import from |
|---|---|
| Any SVG icon | `@/components/icons` |
| User avatar initials circle | `@/components/Avatar` |
| Star or dollar rating | `@/components/RatingDisplay` (`Stars`, `Dollars`, `PostRatingStrip`) |
| Open / Closed pill badge | `@/components/OpenBadge` |
| Profile header block | `@/components/ProfileHeader` |

**Why:** Every time an inline icon or badge was defined in a screen, it drifted from the version in another screen. Inconsistencies compound silently. Shared components make visual consistency free.

---

### `PostRatingStrip` replaces all emoji ratings
Anywhere a post's food / vibe / cost rating is shown, use:
```tsx
import { PostRatingStrip } from '@/components/RatingDisplay'
<PostRatingStrip food={post.food} vibe={post.vibe} cost={post.cost} />
```
Never write `🍴{post.food}`, `🎭{post.vibe}`, or `'$'.repeat(post.cost)` in JSX.

---

### `OpenBadge` replaces all inline open/closed badge styles
```tsx
import { OpenBadge } from '@/components/OpenBadge'
{hasOpenInfo && <OpenBadge openNow={isOpen} />}
```
Never copy the `openBadge*` style block into a new screen.

---

## Hook Declaration Order

### Declare `useMemo`/`useCallback` dependencies before the hook that uses them
```tsx
// ✓ correct
const validLocations = useMemo(() => ..., [savedLocations])
const zoom = useCallback(() => {
  const center = validLocations[0] // safe — declared above
}, [selectedLocation, validLocations])

// ✗ wrong — zoom callback references validLocations before its declaration
const zoom = useCallback(() => { ... }, [validLocations])
const validLocations = useMemo(...)
```
**Why:** JavaScript hoists `const` to temporal dead zone — referencing it before declaration throws at runtime. TypeScript may not catch this.
